It's quite annoying when you are working on your great software and computer speaker keep beeping, which tell you that you are doing something wrong. ( Actually we don't need the stupid computer to remind us about that, right? )

Here's a guide for you guys to stop the annoying beeps in different tools I am working with.

## Stop beeping in vim
Add following config setting under ~/.vimrc to mute the beep generated by vim

``` vim .vimrc
set vb t_vb=     " no visual bell & flash
```

## Stop beeping in tmux
Following settings are need to let tmux session shut-up immediately in tmux's config file ~/.tmuxrc

``` bash .tmuxrc
# disable sound bell
set -g bell-action none
# disable visual bell
set -g visual-bell off
```

## Stop beeping in bash session
There are two config files needed to change, first one's .bashrc and another's .inputrc.

``` bash .bashrc
# setl bell length to zero
setterm -blength 0
```

``` bash .inputrc
# no bell
set bell-style none
```

If you have other suggestion on disable beeping on tools above or other tools, please feel free to let me know.
